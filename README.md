## Contents 

**V.1.0.0 (Base):**
* Fir cones now appear everywhere. Harvest them to obtain its seeds, that you can roast for a light snack, and use the rest as fuel for your fires.
* Bee hives can now be found in every region, a rare sight in the middle of winter. Harvest them to obtain honey, a good source of energy that never expires. Be careful, as thes might be hidden away or in dangerous spots.
* Crows might die sometimes. You can find crow carcasses around dead bodies or other carcasses. Harvest them to obtain their meat and a bunch of feathers.
* Bird nests sometimes fall with its trees. You can break down these nests for a few sticks, and if you are lucky, you may find eggs that you can boil and eat.
* Orcas may get beached on the coast, and some of them are becoming food for other animals. Harvest ravaged orca carcasses, obtain meat and blubber from them.
* Find Halite (Salt rock) in coastal mines and caves. Crush halite with a hammer to obtain salt.
* All meats now have a "salt" button. If you have enough salt, you can salt the meat. Leave the meat indoors for a day and it will cure. Cured meat last twice as long as its cooked counterpart.

* For CandleLight users, Bountiful Foraging+ let you obtain fat from orca blubber and wax from bee hives.
